i want to create a web app based system in next js that can generate 3 documents according to user choice so the user should chose whether to create an invoice(Service Invoice)(so user is taken to the invoice creating page), receipt(Service Receipt)(so also here user is taken to receipt creating page), quotationService Quotation)(as well in this also user is taken to quotation creating page), so the document created should be automatically saved for feature download as well the user can be able to save dcument to the system, download document file to local storage, user can delete any document from the system. The system should not exceed 3 colours but basically light blue and white. The system needs high level of proffessionalism, accuracy. The above document is the template that the user must fill the required fields. The columns the template has include, Item Number, Description, Quantity, Rate, Amount. The system on the user working on the document should be able to perform arithmetic calculations where, Quatity multiplied by Rate you get Amount, then subtotal should be calculated, then VAT should be calculated, then Total.  On the creation the user should fill the fields ie Date, No, To,  Amounts in words, Signature.
